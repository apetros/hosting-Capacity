# hosting-Capacity 
In this project I created two low voltage networks of Electric Authority of Cyprus. 
One overhead and one with underground cables. 

Using Time Series algorithm I investigated the overhead network`s behavior under the impact of PV penetration. 
During the day, the sun radiation changes, thus the power production of PVs, Similarly the load consumtion varies from hour to hour. 
With the use of Time Series algorithm we can see the level of voltage bus and the level of loading of the lines during the day.

I also calculated the maximum hosting capacity for the current network 
With the use of a Monte Carlo simulation I checked the maximum hosting capacity for PV installation.
